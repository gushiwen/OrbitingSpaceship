This chapter explains how to load and draw bitmaps using the pygame.Surface and pygame.image classes. We have already been using this class a bit and just taking it for granted up until now out of necessity. When the Pygame window is created with the call to pygame.display.set_mode(), a Surface object is returned, which we have called screen up to this point. Now we will learn more about this elusive Surface class and what its capabilities are between now and the following chapter, and really in every chapter from now on. Admittedly, we’ve done some interesting work with vector (line-based) graphics up to this point, but now it’s time to study bitmaps, which is where you want to go for a good-looking game.
